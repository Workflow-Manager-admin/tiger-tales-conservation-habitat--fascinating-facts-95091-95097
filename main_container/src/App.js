        Tigers face unprecedented challenges in the wild. With fewer than 4,000 remaining globally, 
        conservation efforts are more critical than ever. Habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife 
        conflict have driven these magnificent creatures to the brink of extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        International organizations work tirelessly to protect tiger populations through anti-poaching 
        patrols, habitat preservation, and community education programs. These initiatives aim to 
        secure a future where tigers can thrive once again in their natural environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent successful conservation projects have seen tiger numbers increase in certain regions, 
        offering hope that with continued effort and global support, we can ensure these iconic 
        predators remain part of our planet's biodiversity.

      <p>
        Tigers inhabit a diverse range of environments across Asia, from the snowy taiga of the Russian 
        Far East to the tropical forests of Indonesia. Each subspecies has adapted to its unique habitat, 
        demonstrating the remarkable versatility of these big cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideal tiger habitat includes dense vegetation for stalking prey, access to water sources, 
        and sufficient territory to support their hunting needs. An adult tiger may require up to 100 
        square kilometers of land to thrive in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, human encroachment continues to fragment these vital habitats, creating isolated 
        tiger populations that struggle to maintain genetic diversity and find adequate resources.
